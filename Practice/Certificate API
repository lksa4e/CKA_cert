1. A new member akshay joined our team. He requires access to our cluster. The Certificate Signing Request is at the /root location.
--> https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/certificate-signing-requests/ (docs -> Certificate signing request 검색)
--> 

2. What is the Condition of the newly created Certificate Signing Request object?
--> kubectl get csr

3. approve
--> kubectl certificate approve myuser

4. Who requested the csr-* request?
--> system:으로 시작하는건 master node

5. During a routine check you realized that there is a new CSR request in place. What is the name of this request?
--> kubectl get csr

6. Hmmm.. You are not aware of a request coming in. What groups is this CSR requesting access to?
Check the details about the request. Preferebly in YAML.
--< kubectl get csr -o yaml

7. That doesn't look very right. Reject that request.
--> kubectl certificate deny <csr name>
