1. Identify the certificate file used for the kube-api server
--> kubectl -n kube-system describe pod kube-apiserver-controlplane
     --tls-cert-file=/etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver.crt

2. Identify the Certificate file used to authenticate kube-apiserver as a client to ETCD Server
  --etcd-certfile=/etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver-etcd-client.crt

3. Identify the key used to authenticate kubeapi-server to the kubelet server
   --kubelet-client-key=/etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver-kubelet-client.key

4. Identify the ETCD Server Certificate used to host ETCD server
--> kubectl -n kube-system describe pod etcd-controlplane
   --cert-file=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt

5. Identify the ETCD Server CA Root Certificate used to serve ETCD Server
ETCD can have its own CA. So this may be a different CA certificate than the one used by kube-api server.
   --trusted-ca-file=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt

6. What is the Common Name (CN) configured on the Kube API Server Certificate?
OpenSSL Syntax: openssl x509 -in file-path.crt -text -noout
--> openssl x509 -in /etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver.crt -text -noout
    Subject: CN = kube-apiserver

7. What is the name of the CA who issued the Kube API Server Certificate?
--> openssl x509 -in /etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver.crt -text -noout
    Issuer: CN = kubernetes
8. Which of the below alternate names is not configured on the Kube API Server Certificate?
--> X509v3 Subject Alternative Name: 
                DNS:controlplane, DNS:kubernetes, DNS:kubernetes.default, DNS:kubernetes.default.svc, 
                DNS:kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local, IP Address:10.96.0.1, IP Address:172.17.0.17

9. What is the Common Name (CN) configured on the ETCD Server certificate?
--> openssl x509 -in /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt -text -noout

10. How long, from the issued date, is the Root CA Certificate valid for?
File: /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.crt
--> openssl x509 -in /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.crt -text -noout

 Validity
            Not Before: Apr 21 13:06:33 2021 GMT
            Not After : Apr 19 13:06:33 2031 GMT

11. Kubectl suddenly stops responding to your commands. Check it out! 
Someone recently modified the /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml file
You are asked to investigate and fix the issue. Once you fix the issue wait for sometime for kubectl to respond. 
Check the logs of the ETCD container.

--> 

12. The kube-api server stopped again! Check it out. Inspect the kube-api server logs and identify the root cause and fix the issue.
Run docker ps -a command to identify the kube-api server container. Run docker logs container-id command to view the logs.

ETCD has its own CA. The right CA must be used for the ETCD-CA file in /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml
