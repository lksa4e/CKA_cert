1. Let us explore the environment first. How many nodes do you see in the cluster?
--> kubectl get nodes

2. How many applications do you see hosted on the cluster?
Check the number of deployments
--> kubectl get deployments

3.On which nodes are the applications hosted on?
--> kubectl get pods -o wide

4. We need to take node01 out for maintenance. Empty the node of all applications and mark it unschedulable.
--> kubectl drain node01 --ignore-daemonsets

5. The maintenance tasks have been completed. Configure the node to be schedulable again.
--> kubectl uncordon node01

6. RS, Daemonset, deployment, Job 등에 의해 생성되지 않은 Pod는 단순 drain으로는 evict 할 수 없음
--> kubectl drain node02 --ignore-daemonsets --force

7. 단순하게 스케쥴링되지 않게만
--> kubectl cordon node03
