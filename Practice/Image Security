1. We decided to use a modified version of the application from an internal private registry. 
Update the image of the deployment to use a new image from myprivateregistry.com:5000
The registry is located at myprivateregistry.com:5000. Don't worry about the credentials for now. 
We will configure them in the upcoming steps.

2. Create a secret object with the credentials required to access the registry
Name: private-reg-cred
Username: dock_user
Password: dock_password
Server: myprivateregistry.com:5000
Email: dock_user@myprivateregistry.com

kubectl create secret docker-registry private-reg-cred --docker-server=myprivateregistry.com:5000 \
--docker-username=dock_user --docker-password=dock_password --docker-email=dock_user@myprivateregistry.com

3. Configure the deployment to use credentials from the new secret to pull images from the private registry

imagePullSecrets:
  - name: private-reg-cred
