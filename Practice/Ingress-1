1. Which namespace is the Ingress Resource deployed in?
--> kubectl get ingress --all-namespaces

2. What is the Host configured on the ingress-resource?
The host entry defines the domain name that users use to reach the application like www.google.com

  Host        Path  Backends
  ----        ----  --------
  *           
              /wear    wear-service:8080    10.244.1.3:8080)
              /watch   video-service:8080   10.244.1.2:8080)

3. What backend is the /wear path on the Ingress configured with?
--> wear-service

4. At what path is the video streaming application made available on the Ingress?
--> /watch

5. If the requirement does not match any of the configured paths what service are the requests forwarded to?
--> Default backend:  default-http-backend:80 (<error: endpoints "default-http-backend" not found>)

6. You are requested to change the URLs at which the applications are made available.
Make the video application available at /stream.
Ingress: ingress-wear-watch
Path: /stream
Backend Service: video-service
Backend Service Port: 8080
--> kubectl edit

7. You are requested to add a new path to your ingress to make the food delivery application available to your customers.
Make the new application available at /eat.
Ingress: ingress-wear-watch
Path: /eat
Backend Service: food-service
Backend Service Port: 8080

8. A new payment service has been introduced. Since it is critical, the new application is deployed in its own namespace.
Identify the namespace in which the new application is deployed (critical-space)

9. You are requested to make the new application available at /pay.
Identify and implement the best approach to making this application available on the ingress controller 
and test to make sure its working. Look into annotations: rewrite-target as well.
