1. Where is the default kubeconfig file located in the current environment?
Find the current home directory by looking at the HOME environment variable
--> 

2. I would like to use the dev-user to access test-cluster-1. Set the current context to the right one so I can do that.
Once the right context is identified, use the 'kubectl config use-context' command.
--> kubectl config --kubeconfig=/root/my-kube-config use-context research

3. We don't want to have to specify the kubeconfig file option on each command. Make the my-kube-config file the default kubeconfig.
--> root/.kube에 있는 config 파일을 바꿔야함

4. With the current-context set to research, we are trying to access the cluster. 
However something seems to be wrong. Identify and fix the issue.
Try running the kubectl get pods command and look for the error. All users certificates are stored at /etc/kubernetes/pki/users

/etc/kubernetes/pki/users/dev-user/
