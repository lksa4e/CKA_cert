1. A pod definition file nginx.yaml is given. Create a pod using the file.
Only create the POD for now. We will inspect its status next.
--> kubectl apply -f nginx.yaml

2. What is the status of the created POD?
--> kubectl get pods

3. Why is the POD in a pending state?
Inspect the environment for various kubernetes control plane components.
--> kubectl describe pod nginx

==> kubectl -n kube-system get pods

4. Manually schedule the pod on node01.
Delete and recreate the POD if necessary.
--> 

5. Now schedule the same pod on the master/controlplane node.
Delete and recreate the POD if necessary.
--> vi nginx.yaml
--> kubectl apply -f nginx.yaml
