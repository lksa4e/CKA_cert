1. How many network policies do you see in the environment?
We have deployed few web applications, services and network policies. Inspect the environment.
--> kubectl get netpol

2. Create a network policy to allow traffic from the 'Internal' application only to the 'payroll-service' and 'db-service'
Use the spec given on the right. You might want to enable ingress traffic to the pod to test your rules in the UI.
Policy Name: internal-policy
Policy Types: Egress
Egress Allow: payroll
Payroll Port: 8080
Egress Allow: mysql
MYSQL Port: 3306

name=internal
mysql ip = 10.244.1.5
payroll ip = 10.244.1.4

apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
