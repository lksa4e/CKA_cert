kubectl get storageclasses.storage.k8s.io

What is the name of the Storage Class that does not support dynamic volume provisioning?
--> Look for the storage class name that uses no-provisioner

RWO
local-storage

Why is the PVC in a pending state despite making a valid request to claim the volume called local-pv?
Inspect the PVC events.

The Storage Class called local-storage makes use of VolumeBindingMode set to WaitForFirstConsumer. 
This will delay the binding and provisioning of a PersistentVolume until a Pod using the PersistentVolumeClaim is created.
