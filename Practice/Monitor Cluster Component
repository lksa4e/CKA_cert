1. We have deployed a few PODs running workloads. Inspect it.

2. Let us deploy metrics-server to monitor the PODs and Nodes. Pull the git repository for the deployment files.
--> git clone https://github.com/kodekloudhub/kubernetes-metrics-server.git

3. Deploy the metrics-server by creating all the components downloaded.
Run the 'kubectl create -f .' command from within the downloaded repository.
--> kubectl create -f kubernetes-metrics-server/

4. It takes a few minutes for the metrics server to start gathering data.
Run the 'kubectl top node' command and wait for a valid output.
--> kubectl top node

5. Identify the node/Pod that consumes the most CPU/Mem.
--> kubectl top node/pods
