-------------------------------------------------
1. The cluster is broken again. We tried deploying an application but it's not working. Troubleshoot and fix the issue.
Start looking at the deployments.

 2. Scale the deployment app to 2 pods.

 3. Even though the depoyment was scaled to 2, the number of PODs does not seem to increase. Investigate and fix the issue.
Inspect the component responsible for managing deployments and replicasets.

4. Something is wrong with scaling again. We just tried scaling the deployment to 3 replicas. But it's not happening.
Investigate and fix the issue
