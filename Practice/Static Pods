1. How many static pods exist in this cluster in all namespaces?
--> kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
==> kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep "\-controlplane"

2. Which of the below components is NOT deployed as a static pod?
--> controlplane이 안붙은 거 

3. On which nodes are the static pods created currently?
--> kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o wide

4. What is the path of the directory holding the static pod definition files?
==> ps -aux | grep kubelet
==> cat /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml

==> ps -ef | grep kubelet
==> grep -i static/var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml


5. How many pod definition files are present in the manifests folder?
--> cd /etc/kubernetes/manifests

6. What is the docker image used to deploy the kube-api server as a static pod?
--> cat kube-apiserver.yaml

7. Create a static pod named static-busybox that uses the busybox image and the command sleep 1000
--> kubectl run static-busybox --image=busybox --command sleep 1000 --restart=Never --dry-run=client -o yaml > static-busybox.yaml

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    run: static-busybox
  name: static-busybox
spec:
  containers:
  - image: busybox
    name: static-busybox
    command: ['sh', '-c',"sleep 1000"]
  dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
  restartPolicy: Always

8. We just created a new static pod named static-greenbox. Find it and delete it.
This question is a bit tricky. But if you use the knowledge you gained in the previous questions in this lab, 
you should be able to find the answer to it.
--> SSH로 Node01에 접속해야함
--> kubectl get nodes node01 -o wide
--> ssh <ip>
--> ps -aux | grep kubelet
--> cd, rm yaml file
--> exit

==> ps -ef | grep kubelet | grep "\--config"
==> grep -i static /var/...경로
