1. How many Nodes are part of this cluster?
Including master and worker nodes


2. How many weave agents/peers are deployed in this cluster?

3. On which nodes are the weave peers present?
--> kubectl get pods --all-namespaces  -o wide

4. Identify the name of the bridge network/interface created by weave on each node
--> ip link
==6: weave: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1376 qdisc noqueue state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 06:a9:f6:0f:2d:d6 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff

5. What is the POD IP address range configured by weave?
weave: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1376 qdisc noqueue state UP group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 06:a9:f6:0f:2d:d6 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 10.34.0.0/12 brd 10.47.255.255 scope global weave
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 fe80::4a9:f6ff:fe0f:2dd6/64 scope link

6. What is the default gateway configured on the PODs scheduled on node03?
Try scheduling a pod on node03 and check ip route output
--> kubectl run busybox --image=busybox --command sleep 1000 --dry-run=client -o yaml > pod.yaml
    vi pod.yaml 
    specÏùò nodeName: node03
    kubectl exec -it busybox -- busybox
    ip route (in node03 container)
