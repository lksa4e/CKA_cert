1. We have deployed a number of PODs. They are labelled with tier, env and bu. How many PODs exist in the dev environment?
Use selectors to filter the output
--> kubectl get pods -l env=dev
==> kubectl get pods --show-labels
==> kubectl get pods -l env=dev --no-headers | wc -l

2. How many PODs are in the finance business unit (bu)?
--> kubectl get pods -l bu=finance

3. How many objects are in the prod environment including PODs, ReplicaSets and any other objects?
--> kubectl get all -l env=prod 

4. Identify the POD which is part of the prod environment, the finance BU and of frontend tier?
--> kubectl get pods -l env=prod,bu=finance,tier=frontend

5. A ReplicaSet definition file is given replicaset-definition-1.yaml. 
Try to create the replicaset. There is an issue with the file. Try to fix it.
--> vi
