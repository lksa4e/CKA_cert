1. Run the script named curl-test.sh to send multiple requests to test the web application. Take a note of the output.
Execute the script at /root/curl-test.sh.
--> sh curl-test.sh
Hello, Application Version: v1 ; Color: blue OK

2. Inspect the deployment and identify the current strategy
--> kubectl describe deployment frontend

3. If you were to upgrade the application now what would happen?
--> PODs are upgraded few at a time

4. Let us try that. Upgrade the application by setting the image on the deployment to kodekloud/webapp-color:v2
Do not delete and re-create the deployment. Only set the new image name for the existing deployment.
--> kubectl set image deployment/frontend simple-webapp=kodekloud/webapp-color:v2
--> kubectl edit deployment frontend

5. Run the script curl-test.sh again. Notice the requests now hit both the old and newer versions. However none of them fail.
Execute the script at /root/curl-test.sh.

6. Up to how many PODs can be down for upgrade at a time
Consider the current strategy settings and number of PODs - 4
--> 1

7. Change the deployment strategy to Recreate
Do not delete and re-create the deployment. Only update the strategy type for the existing deployment.

8. Upgrade the application by setting the image on the deployment to kodekloud/webapp-color:v3
Do not delete and re-create the deployment. Only set the new image name for the existing deployment.
