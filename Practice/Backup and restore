1. We have a working kubernetes cluster with a set of applications running. Let us first explore the setup.
How many deployments exist in the cluster?

2. What is the version of ETCD running on the cluster?
Check the ETCD Pod or Process
--> kubectl describe pod -n kube-system etcd-controlplane

3. At what address can you reach the ETCD cluster from the controlplane node?
Check the ETCD Service configuration in the ETCD POD
--> kubectl describe pod -n kube-system etcd-controlplane
--> --listen-client-urls=https://127.0.0.1:2379,https://10.252.68.6:2379

4. Where is the ETCD server certificate file located?
Note this path down as you will need to use it later
    Command:
      etcd
      --advertise-client-urls=https://10.252.68.6:2379
      --cert-file=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt

5. Where is the ETCD CA Certificate file located?
Note this path down as you will need to use it later.
      --trusted-ca-file=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt

6. The master nodes in our cluster are planned for a regular maintenance reboot tonight. While we do not anticipate anything to go wrong, we are required to take the necessary backups. Take a snapshot of the ETCD database using the built-in snapshot functionality.
Store the backup file at location /opt/snapshot-pre-boot.db

ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl --endpoints https://127.0.0.1:2379 \
--cacert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt \
--cert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt \
--key=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.key \
snapshot save /opt/snapshot-pre-boot.db

7. Wake up! We have a conference call! After the reboot the master nodes came back online, 
but none of our applications are accessible. Check the status of the applications on the cluster. What's wrong?


ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl --endpoints=https://[127.0.0.1]:2379 \
--cacert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt \
--name=master \
--cert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt \
--key=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.key \
--data-dir /var/lib/etcd-from-backup \
--initial-cluster=master=https://127.0.0.1:2379 \
--initial-cluster-token=etcd-cluster-1 \
--initial-advertise-peer-urls=https://127.0.0.1:2379 \
snapshot restore /opt/snapshot-pre-boot.db
