1. What is the network interface configured for cluster connectivity on the master node?
(node-to-node communication)
--> Run the 'ip link' command and identify the interface
--> ifconfig -a
--> cat /etc/network/interfaces <-- ubuntu 적용

ens3: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 02:42:ac:11:00:13 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff


2. What is the IP address assigned to the master node on this interface?
--> ip addr
ens3: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 02:42:ac:11:00:08 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 172.17.0.8/16 brd 172.17.255.255 scope global ens3
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 fe80::42:acff:fe11:8/64 scope link 
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
--> Run the command kubectl get nodes -o wide and look for IP assigned to master node
   172.17.0.8

3. What is the MAC address of the interface on the master node?

4. Master의 Mac address 
--> link/ether 02:42:ac:11:00:08 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff

5. What is the IP / MAC address assigned to node01? ( ip : 172.17.0.12)
--> ssh node01 ifconfig ens3

--> Run the command arp node01 on the master node
--> arp
Address                  HWtype  HWaddress           Flags Mask            Iface
node01                   ether   02:42:ac:11:00:0c   C                     ens3

6. We use Docker as our container runtime. What is the interface/bridge created by Docker on this host?
--> docker0

7. What is the state of the interface docker0?
--> ip link show docker0
--> ip addr show docker0
docker0: <NO-CARRIER,BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state DOWN group default 
    link/ether 02:42:1d:e8:88:42 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 172.18.0.1/24 brd 172.18.0.255 scope global docker0
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever

8. If you were to ping google from the master node, which route does it take?
What is the IP address of the Default Gateway?
--> ip route 
default via 172.17.0.1 dev ens3

9. What is the port the kube-scheduler is listening on in the master node?
--> netstat -nplt
--> netstat -natulp | grep kube-scheduler
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State       PID/Program name
tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:10259         0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      2280/kube-scheduler
tcp6       0      0 :::10251                :::*                    LISTEN      2280/kube-scheduler

--> 10251

10. Notice that ETCD is listening on two ports. Which of these have more client connections established?
--> netstat -nplt | grep etcd | grep LISTEN
tcp        0      0 172.17.0.8:2379         0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      2220/etcd           
tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:2379          0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      2220/etcd           
tcp        0      0 172.17.0.8:2380         0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      2220/etcd           
tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:2381          0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      2220/etcd

Correct! That's because 2379 is the port of ETCD to which all control plane components connect to. 
2380 is only for etcd peer-to-peer connectivity. When you have multiple master nodes. In this case we don't.
